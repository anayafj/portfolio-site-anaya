    "info": "Hi, i\u2019m Francisco Anaya a front-end developer living in Los Angeles, California. I have been in the online advertising industry for over 14 years. I have had the pleasure to work for many clients in the entertainment industry along with many great coworkers that I had learned from and been in the trenches with. Before moving to LA I attended the Academy of Arts University in San Francisco where I earned my B.A. in Advertising. At the same time, living in San Francisco was a great experience in it\u2019s self with all the architecture, history, art, culture, and diversity. I grew up in Santa Cruz, California which may explain my chill, laid back personality. \r\n\r\nI started my career designing and animating online banner ads with Adobe Flash. Soon moved more into rich media and programing where I worked more with video and audio. I became very versed in tools like: Adobe Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects, and video compression software. Later I joined a great team at BLT Communications, a leading creative agency in the entertainment industry. There I became part of the new Digital Department focusing on the development of online ads for their entertainment clients like: ABC, HBO, AMC, Netflix, Hulu and more. In late 2015, Adobe Flash was on it\u2019s death bed and shortly all ads would have to be built with HTML5 , CSS, and Javascript. It was an opportunity to learn new skills and test my resolve in overcoming this challenge. So with these new set of skills the opportunity to join the development department opened up along with new possibilities. Soon I was building websites and diving deeper into web development.\r\n\r\nLately I have been focusing on growing to become a front-end developer. I have expanded my skills to learn: React, Redux, Typescript, and more. I have become more adept to using the command line and git repo. I know there is more to learn and look forward to every opportunity that gives me more experience."
