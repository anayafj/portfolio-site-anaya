    "info": "Hi! I'm Frankie. I'm a Front-End developer and I live in Los Angeles. I enjoy projects that involve all types of creativity and technology.\n\n I've been in online advertising for years, most recently at a creative agency that services the entertainment industry. I've had the chance to design, animate, and build online ads. Shortly after that, I gravitated towards web development.\n\n  Growth is what I search for in my Front-End Development journey. I look for more opportunities to build upon what I already know and to produce quality work that not just functions right, but look fresh!"
